
Wire buttons on bread board.
Program button handler:
    ..pin change interupt
    ..process buttons on change
        ..get pressed info

LCD:
    wire it
    add menu flow

Wheel Manager
    add wheel listener
        use similar set up form buttons
    use an external interupt to log wheel tick

Enclosure:
    make one
    abs project box
    extruded aluminum rectangle
    project board layout

Power Plan:
    start with naive approach draining battery quickly
    add sleep between inputs (wheel, button)
    Add battery charger from 12v


    Stand-alone AVR

oops, i ordered the wrong part. 
I got the non-pico power version.
that is the 328 PU, i want the 328P PU. I am calling avrdude with -F to force 
otherwise upload would fail on chip signature missmatch.

I flashed Lilypad (8 MHz) loader which uses the internal 8Mhz clock.

I succeeded uploading to the stand alone avr with an ftdi cable
as described in https://gammon.com.au/breadboard.

FTDI cable          Target board
Pin 1 (GND)  blk    Gnd (blue)
Pin 2 (CTS)         not connected
Pin 3 (Vcc)  red    +5V (red)
Pin 4 (TxD   orng   Pin 2 (RxD) (white)
Pin 5 (RxD)  yllw   Pin 3 (TxD) (orange)
Pin 6 (RTS)  grn    To Reset via 0.1 uF capacitor (green)

    Successful upload target board selection in Arduino IDE:
Duemilanove
LilyPad


Successful programed with aarduino as isp with platform io!
Using Nano as ISP running Arduino as ISP sketch.
